## ‚ùì ANTICIPATED JUDGE QUESTIONS

### Technical
**Q: "Which AI models do you use?"**  
A: "Five models: Ollama LLM for chat, ArTST for Arabic speech, Stable Diffusion for comics, our Content Safety AI for moderation, and Emotion Analysis AI using the Plutchik model."

**Q: "How do you ensure user privacy?"**  
A: "Most AI processing happens locally or on our servers - no data sent to third parties. We never use personal conversations to train models. Users can export or delete data anytime."

**Q: "What about content moderation?"**  
A: "Our AI safety system uses pattern matching to detect profanity, violence, and self-harm. Scores below 60/100 are flagged. Self-harm detection triggers crisis intervention with emergency resources."

### Business
**Q: "How will you monetize?"**  
A: "Freemium model - free tier with basic features, premium at $4.99/month or $49.99/year. Premium includes unlimited comics, advanced breathing exercises, and priority support."

**Q: "What's your target market?"**  
A: "Arabic-speaking youth aged 13-24, primarily in MENA region and diaspora communities. 200M+ potential users facing mental health stigma."

**Q: "How is this different from therapy chatbots?"**  
A: "We're **non-clinical** - focused on emotional learning through storytelling and gamification. We complement professional care, not replace it. Cultural metaphors (the falcon) resonate with our audience."

### Impact
**Q: "How do you measure success?"**  
A: "Engagement metrics (daily active users, feathers earned), emotional wellbeing scores (self-reported mood trends), and community activity (posts, support messages)."

**Q: "What about crisis situations?"**  
A: "Our AI detects self-harm language and immediately displays crisis resources with emergency hotlines. We're an emotional learning tool, not crisis intervention - we direct users to professional help."
