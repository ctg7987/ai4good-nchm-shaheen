UsageTracker.getComicsRemaining() → 0-5 or Infinity
UsageTracker.canGenerateComic() → true/false
UsageTracker.trackComicGenerated() → updates count
UsageTracker.startFreeTrial() → activates 7-day premium
```

### Premium Modal Integration
```typescript
// App.tsx exports global function
import { openPremiumModal } from '../App';

// Call from anywhere
openPremiumModal(); // Opens upgrade modal
```

### Gated Features
```tsx
// Check if feature is locked
const isLocked = !UsageTracker.isPremium();

// Show upgrade button
{isLocked && (
  <button onClick={openPremiumModal}>
    🔓 Upgrade to Premium
  </button>
)}
